## About this Document

This specification is for the Verana Indexer, a container-based App easily deployable locally, or in any modern cloud infrastructure.

## Introduction

*This section is non-normative.*

### Why We Need the Verana Indexer

1. **Ledger Storage Is Expensive**  
   * Every on-chain byte costs gas or block space.  
   * To keep fees low, a VPR stores only the **minimum viable record** (IDs, hashes, pointers, values).

2. **Limited Native Indexing**  
   * Blockchains are append-only logs, not SQL engines.  
   * Adding many on-chain indexes would explode storage costs and slow consensus.

3. **Query Complexity**  
   * Wallets and services still need fast look-ups:  
     - *Is this credential issued by an authorized issuer?*  
     - *Which credential schema contains the word "name"?*  
   * Without an indexer, youâ€™d have to **scan the entire chain** for each query, which is costly and impractical.

4. **Trust Resolution**
   * Trust-resolving a DID with the [Verre] library takes some time.
   * Data stored in credentials is not present in the ledger.
   * Without the indexer, it would not be possible to search credential attributes.

### ðŸ”§ Enter the Verana Indexer

| Feature | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| **Ledger Listener** | Subscribes to new blocks & events. |
| **Selective Ingest** | Index only new information or modified information. |
| **Off-Chain Database** | Builds optimized tables & secondary indexes. |
| **Real-Time Updates** | Each ledger new block triggers an index refresh, keeping data in sync. |
| **Lightweight Container** | Runs anywhere: validator nodes, cloud, or self-hosted. |

With the Verana Indexer, the ledger stays lean, yet wallets, verifiers, and dashboards get millisecond-fast queries. It marries on-chain integrity with off-chain speed, and makes every credential uncovered during trust resolution instantly searchable.

## [IDX-GENERAL]

:::note
examples are given for understanding only and are non-normative.
:::

## [IDX-COMMONS]

### Basic Cosmos-SDK data

Commons used cosmos-sdk modules and produced data MUST be indexed.

### [IDX-COMMONS-VERANA] Verana Data

#### [IDX-COMMONS-VERANA-REQUEST] Mandatory Request Parameters

All Verana methods MUST include the following mandatory parameters:

- `query_at` (timestamp) (*optional*): if set, query *at* `query_at`, else query *at* now(). Used to query the ledger state at a previous datetime.

:::warning
Be careful with the `query_at`. Returned data MUST be properly calculated. Example: if a permission has been revoked today and a query returns the same permission *at* yesterday, permission MUST NOT appear revoked in the future in the returned data, it MUST be returned as it was at the specific datetime. For slashed perms, it implies having a copy of all slashs to properly recalculate the permission state at an earlier date.
:::

#### [IDX-COMMONS-VERANA-RESPONSE] Mandatory Response Parameters

All query response MUST include at least:

- `index_ts` (timestamp): a timestamp that matches the last indexed block of the chain;
- `height` (number): the block height;
- `query_at` (timestamp): the datetime *at* which the query response is valid.

```

## [IDX-SESS]

Permission Sessions MUST be indexed.

## [IDX-DD]

DID Directory MUST be indexed.

## [IDX-TD]

Trust Deposits MUST be indexed.

## [IDX-GLOBAL]

Global Variables MUST be indexed.

## [QUERY]

All query answers MUST be paginated.

## Implementation

As several cosmos-sdk based chain indexer implementations exist, it will be faster to fork and extend one instead of rebuilding everything from scratch. You should do your own research and we should discuss the choice before starting to build.
